Darling, you You give, but you cannot take love  [Verse 2: Drake] Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different Started realizing a couple places I could take it I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation And influence a generation that's lacking in patience I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience Just me and my old man getting back to basics We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted When he put that bottle down, girl, that nigga's amazing Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us We even talked about you and our couple of moments He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone Looking like you came from the seventies on your own My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is ""Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone?"" You don't even know what you want from love anymore I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for?

Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't? Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz Girl, I felt like we had it all planned out I guess I fucked up the vision Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven It seem like you don't want this love anymore I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—   [Chorus] I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God Kneel before General Zod This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard  [Verse 3] So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin You rodent, I'm omnipotent Let off, then I'm reloadin' Immediately with these bombs I'm totin' And I should not be woken I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin' But I got your mom deep-throatin' I'm out my Ramen Noodle We have nothin' in common, poodle I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil It's me, my honesty's brutal But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though For good at least once in a while So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes To maybe try to help get some people through tough times But I gotta keep a few punchlines Just in case 'cause even you unsigned Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime I know there was a time where once I Was king of the underground But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine Appeal with the skin color of mine You get too big and here they come tryin' To censor you like that one line I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9 See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows You write normal? Fuck being normal! And I just bought a new raygun from the future Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad 'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad Singin' to a man while he played piano Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel So Ray J went straight to the radio station The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"" Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad) Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated I make elevating music, you make elevator music ""Oh, he's too mainstream."" Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it ""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it With rock, shock rap with Doc Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it ""I don't know how to make songs like that I don't know what words to use."" Let me know when it occurs to you While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you How many verses I gotta murder to Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?! Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie But look at the accolades these skills brung me Full of myself, but still hungry I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to And I'm a million leagues above you Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel I'ma sleep in the front seat Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky"" But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have, then you may be a little patient And more sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then! But if I can't batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then? Don't mistake him for Satan It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not Why be a king when you can be a god?"

Shh, Mama's only gone for the moment   [Chorus] Now hush, little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We feel how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise Mama's gon' be alright  [Outro] And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird I'ma give you the world I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine I'ma break that birdie's neck I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad (Haha)"

Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop Amoxicillin's just not real enough The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners You're comin' with me, feel it or not You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up? Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck   [Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem] 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof, until the roof) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off, the roof comes off) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)  [Verse 2: Eminem] Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit This is your moment, and every single minute you spend Tryna hold on to it, 'cause you may never get it again So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end 'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in It goes: Reggie, JAY-Z, 2Pac and Biggie André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney—Nate, hit me!   [Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem] 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high?

How not to go against me, smart And it's absurd how people hang on every word I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first 'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static? 'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so   [Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem] 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high?

Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't! Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again I guess I don't know my own strength  [Chorus: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?

Lana Del Rey,15740,Ride Monologue,445923,"62 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolRide Monologue Lyrics[Pre-Song] I was in the winter of my life And the men I met along the road were my only summer At night I fell asleep with visions of myself dancing and laughing and crying with them Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me And my only real happy times I was a singer Not a very popular one I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet But upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky That I wished on over and over again, sparkling and broken But I didn’t really mind because I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is When the people I used to know found out what I had been doing how I had been living, they asked me why, but there’s no use in talking to people who have a home They have no idea what its like to seek safety in other people For home to be wherever you lie your head I was always an unusual girl My mother told me that I had a chameleon soul No moral compass pointing due north No fixed personality Just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean And if I said I didn’t plan for it to turn out this way I’d be lying  Because I was born to be the other woman Who belonged to no one Who belonged to everyone Who had nothing Who wanted everything With a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that I couldn’t even talk about it And pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me   [Song] [Post-Song] Every night I used to pray that I’d find my people And finally I did On the open road We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired anymore Except to make our lives into a work of art Live fast Die young Be wild And have fun I believe in the country America used to be I believe in the person I want to become I believe in the freedom of the open road And my motto is the same as ever ""I believe in the kindness of strangers"" And when I'm at war with myself I ride I just ride Who are you? Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies? Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them?   I have I am fucking crazy But I am free"

Cole] To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling You keep falling victim 'cause you're insecure And when I tell you that you're beautiful, you can't be sure 'Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin' So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin' Take it from a man that loves what you got And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care 'Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see That the hands can't touch, that them broads can't be And that's you, never let 'em see your frown And if you need a friend to pick you up, I'll be around And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud I can tell you ain't laughed in a while But I wanna see that crooked smile   [Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson] Even though I— On my way, on my way, on my way down On my way, on my way, on my way down You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round  [Post-Chorus: J. Cole T-Boz & Chilli] We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round [Verse 3: J. Cole] We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens But we got dreams and we got the right to chase 'em Look at the nation That's a crooked smile braces couldn't even straighten Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail Wonder why we inhale, 'cause we in Hell already I ask: If my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele? But one more time for the 'Ville And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let's make a mil' Hey officer man, we don't want nobody gettin' killed Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail I got money for the bail now, and well now If you askin' will I tell now—ayy, hell nah I ain't snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now If you was around then you wouldn't need a witness now How you like this crooked smile?   [Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J. Cole)] Even though I— On my way, on my way, on my way down On my way, on my way, on my way down (That crooked smile) You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round  [Post-Chorus: J. Cole T-Boz & Chilli] We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round  [Ad-Libs: Choir]  [Outro: Choir] La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la On my way, on my way, on my way down On my way, on my way, on my way down You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round Back round You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round Back round You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round Round  [Music Video]"

Know that I'ma ride for you, either way it go Tell me, girl, why you be stressin' me for time? (Time, time, time, time, time, time) When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb? Damn, my nigga, why you actin' like a bitch? (Bitch, bitch, bitch) If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich? Come here, baby, why you always insecure? ('Cure, cure, cure, cure, cure, cure) Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure  [Bridge] (Who's the king?) Came from the bottom, nigga, with stains on my shirt What you expected from me, I came from the dirt (Who's the king?) Money my motivator, the songs that I sing Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king (Who's the king?) You tell me you still love me, if so then let me go Will I return or will I burn, never know (Who's the king?) Look in my eyes and see the future But don't sugar coat it (Yeah) [Verse 3] Listen, history repeats itself and that's just how it goes Same way that these rappers always bite each other's flows Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock 'n Roll Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound This year I'll prolly go to the awards dappered down Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit Same rope you climb up on, they hang you with But not Jermaine, my aim too sick I bang, nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid And break the chains and change minds One verse at a time, and claim 2-6 And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?   [Outro] We all kings (We all kings, nigga) Kings of ourselves first and foremost (True) While the people debate who's the king of this rap game (Hehehaha) Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine With every ounce of strength in his veins To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it (True) But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic With a flash and a bang, the crown disintegrates And falls to the Earth from which it came It's done Ain't gon' be no more kings (Ain't gon' be no more kings) Be wary of any man that claims Because deep down he clings onto the need for power (Mm) In reality he's a coward (Mm) Ultimately he's scared to die And sometimes so am I But when I'm in tune with the most high I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side (The other side, ayy) Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I (Yessir) Different kind of skin, different set of eyes Two different minds, but only one God (It's only one God, nigga) It's for all the kings (Uh) 'Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved"

Cole] Yeah (For your eyes) For your eyes only (For your eyes) For your eyes only, for your eyes only (For your eyes, for your eyes) For your eyes only  [Verse 1: J. Cole] Hey, niggas be dyin' on the daily It seems my dreams faded for far too long The consequences deadly Can't visualize myself as nothin' but a criminal Control the block, servin' up rocks and stay subliminal 'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they lettin' off Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause Ain't no comin' back, family dressed in black Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressin' me Like I ain't the one who put them Js on her feet Like I ain't out in the field like that I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless Screamin', ""Fuck the law,"" my life is lawless That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic I try to find employment even if it's wipin' toilets But these felonies be makin' life the hardest Resistin' the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike, and pawn it That's why I write this sonnet If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it (For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it (For your eyes) For your eyes only   [Chorus: J. Cole] For your eyes, do you understand? For your eyes, do you understand me? For your eyes, do you understand? For your eyes, do you understand me? For your eyes, do you understand? For your eyes, do you understand me? For your eyes, do you understand? For your eyes only  [Verse 2: J. Cole] You prolly grown now, so this song'll hit you If you hearin' this, unfortunately means that I'm no longer with you In the physical, not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive He got me prayin' that the spiritual is real So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too So I know how part of you feels Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots And fiends that smoke rocks I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot I'm writin' this because me and the devil had a dance Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizin' in advance Don't know if I ever had a chance At a glance, I'm a failure Addicted to pushin' paraphernalia But daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years My pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hangin' Blood was stainin' the concrete Older niggas I loved, talked like they was above Maintainin' a timesheet, that's slow money Picked up the family business, by the age of thirteen Six years later was handed sentence 'Round the same time is when you came in this world Me and your mama thinkin': ""What the fuck we namin' this girl?"" I told her, ""Nina,"" the prettiest name that I could think of (Most prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen) For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was nineteen Took me two felonies to see the trap this crooked-ass system set for me And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be The one that set examples that was never set for me I'm livin' fast, but not fast enough 'Cause karma keeps on catchin' up to me And if my past becomes the death of me I hope you understand   [Chorus: J. Cole] For your eyes, do you understand? For your eyes, do you understand me? For your eyes, do you understand? (Hope you understand) For your eyes, do you understand me? For your eyes, do you understand? (Hope you understand) For your eyes, do you understand me? For your eyes, do you understand? For your eyes only  [Verse 3: J. Cole] It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count Was it the trigger-happy crackers that the badges give clout? Was it the young niggas, blastin' frustrated 'cause the cash runnin' out? Niggas don't know how to act in a drought See, baby girl, I realized my definition of a real nigga was skewed My views misshaped by new mixtapes That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food I was a fool, spent all my time duckin' school, duckin' cops Duckin' rules, huggin' blocks that don't love you I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops And the cyclical nature of doin' time continues My worst fear is one day that you come home from school And see your father face while hearin' 'bout tragedy on news I got the strangest feelin' your daddy gonna lose his life soon And sadly if you're listenin' now it must mean it's true But maybe there's a chance that it's not And this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels And I can teach you this in person like I'm teachin' you to tie your own shoes I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you For your eyes only   [Chorus: CharGaux & J. Cole] For your eyes, for your eyes only For your eyes, for your eyes only For your eyes, do you understand? For your eyes only  [Verse 4: J. Cole] One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feelin' What he'd been dealin' with lately, he wasn't tellin' I tried to pick his brains, still, he wasn't revealin' But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice And it was chillin', he said: ""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children I never asked for nothin', when times was hard I never had discussions with you, beggin' you to help me I dealt with the repercussions of my actions I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit But that shit was in my blood, you know my life I know your momma, nigga, send my love In case I never get a chance to speak again I won't forget the weekends spent sleepin' at your crib That's the way I wished my family lived But my granny crib was in the 'jects"" I had to interject like: ""Nigga, what you talkin' 'bout? Fuck is you gettin' at?"" He said, ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions But I been havin' premonitions Just call it visions from the other side I got a feelin' I won't see tomorrow Like the time I'm livin' on is borrowed With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father Write my story down, and if I pass Go play it for my daughter when she ready"" And so I'm leavin' you this record, for your eyes only Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son I dedicate these words to you and all the other children Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation That sent your pops to prison when he needed education Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better Although I know that means that I would never Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old Now it's thirty years later, makin' sure this story's told Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold Not because he was the first to get some pussy, twelve years old Not because he used to come through in the Caddy on some vogues Not because he went from baggin' up them grams to servin' O's Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars Not because he screamed, ""Fuck the law"" Although that was true Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you For your eyes only"
